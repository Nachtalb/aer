# aer

Simple web interface to search through tagged files. File tagging is done with
the filename: `(my_tag)(another tag).bin` Aliases are also managed when renaming
a file. So eg. the tag `shocked` becomes `(shock)(shocked)(surprised)(!)(ðŸ˜®)`.

While not implemented yet that's at least the goal. Basically a replacement of
[eary](https://github.com/Nachtalb/eary) written in rust to be faster.
